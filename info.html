    <div class="price">If you make it yourself, it will cost around 100 USD</div>
    <div class="minfo">hello. I am a maker living in Korea. I completed my string art machine. The software was also completed. <br>
      I tried selling on etsy but gave up. The reason is because of the price. This is because of transportation costs, transit time, and stability. <br>
      If the price gets too high, this project will be meaningless. My efforts are meaningless. <br>
      Those of you who have looked closely at my machines will know that all the parts are the cheapest bulk products, <br>
      and I combined the idea with inexpensive items such as straws, stationery clamps, and jenga block, pin header ,MDF etc.<br><br>

      Nevertheless, I hope that many people will be able to purchase string art at an affordable price. <br>
      I have seen people wishing to make it in places such as India, Spain, the United States, Europe, and Taiwan. <br>
      If these people try to sell to their own citizens or nearby, I think they will be able to lower the price sufficiently. <br>
      I want to sell my machine in Korea. So I need something viral. My goal is not to sell overseas. I would like to ask those who agree with my thoughts. help.<br><br>
      
      there are requirements for those who want to help me. <br>
      It may vary depending on the region, but you must have the investment cost to complete one machine. <br>
      That cost includes the cost of purchasing parts, but also includes the cost of power drills, trimmers, and other miscellaneous equipment. <br>
      So, for experienced makers, the initial investment cost excluding equipment cost is about 150 USD. <br>
      Also, you must have a laser processing machine and 3D printer or be able to use one nearby(like maker space).<br><br>
      
      If you have anyone who would like to join me, please let me know through guestbook. <br>
      I will give you all the information I have. For parts that are difficult to explain through video, we can explain through google meet. I will upload a very detailed video of the machine being completed on YouTube.<br>
      Thank you to everyone who read this article. be happy.</div>
